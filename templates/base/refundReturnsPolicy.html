                                            We have a 7 days easy return policy for most of the items,
                                            however, specific return periods may apply for certain types of items while
                                            certain items are not returnable unless there is a problem with their
                                            quality.

                                            If there is an issue with your order, you are requested to inform us
                                            immediately and not within 24 hours of receiving the product. Returns should
                                            be made within 7 days of receiving the items in original, undamaged and
                                            everything included and intact packaging. In most cases, original and
                                            undamaged packaging refer to the manufacturer’s packaging that the product
                                            was delivered to you in. An item being returned should also be returned with
                                            any accessories, manuals, and items that may have been bundled with the
                                            item.

                                            If the product being returned is not in a fully re-saleable condition, or
                                            the packaging is damaged, or accessories, manuals or bundled items may be
                                            missing, we reserve the right to refuse a refund on the item or deduct up to
                                            80% of the original selling price from the refund amount. Refund will be
                                            added to your babys.com.bd account as Store Credit/Equivalent Plus Points or
                                            in cash/bKash. Other cases if everything is as it is and fulfills all our
                                            refund policy, we are good to offer you the full refund without any

                                            natural issue, the product can be exchanged one time for FREE or when you
